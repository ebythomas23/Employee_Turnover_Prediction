<p># Employee Turnover Prediction  </p>
<p>Predicting employee turnover using machine learning models to help organizations understand the reasons behind employee exits and make data-driven decisions to improve retention.  </p>
<p>---  </p>
<p>## Project Overview  </p>
<p>Employee Turnover Prediction involves predicting whether an employee is likely to leave the organization. This predictive analysis helps organizations:<br>- Plan workforce needs by anticipating potential exits.<br>- Improve employee satisfaction by identifying factors influencing turnover.<br>- Implement targeted retention strategies to minimize turnover.  </p>
<p>---  </p>
<p>## Dataset  </p>
<p>- **Source**: HR.csv (included in the `Dataset` folder)<br>- **Features**:<br>- `Satisfaction Level`<br>- `Last Evaluation`<br>- `Number of Projects`<br>- `Average Monthly Hours`<br>- `Time Spent in Company`<br>- `Work Accident`<br>- `Promotion in Last 5 Years`<br>- `Salary`<br>- `Sales Department`  </p>

<p>## Models Used  </p>
<p>1. **Logistic Regression**:<br>- Performed moderately well but showed lower recall for class 1 (employees who left).<br>- Confusion matrix showed more false negatives compared to Random Forest.  </p>
<p>2. **Random Forest Classifier**:<br>- Achieved high accuracy with balanced precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>- Minimal misclassifications observed in the confusion matrix.<br>- Outperformed Logistic Regression significantly.  </p>
<p>---  </p>
<p>## Confusion Matrix and Classification Report  </p>
<p>We used confusion matrices and classification reports to evaluate the models, focusing on precision, recall, and F1-score.  </p>
<p>### Random Forest<br>- High accuracy with balanced precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>- Minimal misclassifications, as shown in the confusion matrix.  </p>
<p>### Logistic Regression<br>- Moderate performance but lower recall for class 1 (employees who left).<br>- More false negatives compared to Random Forest.  </p>
<p>---  </p>
<p>## ROC Curve  </p>
<p>- The ROC curve compares model performance by plotting True Positive Rate vs. False Positive Rate.<br>- **Random Forest** shows a significantly higher AUC (0.98) compared to **Logistic Regression** (0.57), indicating its superior performance.  </p>
<p>---  </p>
<p>## Feature Importance  </p>
<p>We analyzed feature importance to understand the factors influencing employee turnover.  </p>
<p>### Key Findings:<br>- Top features influencing turnover include:<br>- **Satisfaction Level** (38.80%)<br>- **Average Monthly Hours** (21.03%)<br>- **Last Evaluation** (19.57%)<br>- **Number of Projects** (18.49%)<br>- Less influential features include:<br>- **Time Spent in Company** (1.13%)<br>- **Work Accident** (0.21%)<br>- **Promotion in Last 5 Years** (0.19%)<br>- **Salary** (0.20%)<br>- **Sales Department (IT &amp; R&amp;D)** (0.18% - 0.20%)  </p>
<p>These insights help in making informed business decisions and developing targeted employee retention strategies.  </p>

<p>1. **Clone the Repository**:<br>```bash<br>git clone <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/EMPLOYEE%5C_TURNOVER%5C_PREDICTION.git">https://github.com/yourusername/EMPLOYEE\_TURNOVER\_PREDICTION.git</a><br>cd EMPLOYEE_TURNOVER_PREDICTION<br>```  </p>
<p>2. **Set up Virtual Environment**:<br>```bash<br>python -m venv venv<br>source venv/bin/activate # On MacOS/Linux<br>venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows<br>```  </p>
<p>3. **Install Required Packages**:<br>```bash<br>pip install -r requirements.txt<br>```  </p>
<p>4. **Run the Notebook**:<br>- Open Jupyter Notebook or VSCode and run the `01_end_to_end.ipynb` notebook.<br>- This notebook performs the complete analysis, including:<br>- Data Preprocessing<br>- Model Training (Logistic Regression and Random Forest)<br>- Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, ROC Curve)<br>- Feature Importance Analysis  </p>
<p>---  </p>
<p>## Results  </p>
<p>- **Random Forest Classifier** achieved 98% accuracy, outperforming Logistic Regression.<br>- **Satisfaction Level**, **Average Monthly Hours**, **Last Evaluation**, and **Number of Projects** were the most influential features.<br>- The model provides valuable insights to HR departments for developing effective employee retention strategies.  </p>
<p>---  </p>
<p>## Conclusion  </p>
<p>This project demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged to predict employee turnover and provide actionable insights for organizations. By understanding key factors influencing employee exits, companies can proactively address issues and improve employee satisfaction and retention.  </p>
