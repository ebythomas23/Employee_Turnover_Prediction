\# Employee Turnover Prediction  
  
Predicting employee turnover using machine learning models to help organizations understand the reasons behind employee exits and make data-driven decisions to improve retention.  
  
\---  
  
\## Project Overview  
  
Employee Turnover Prediction involves predicting whether an employee is likely to leave the organization. This predictive analysis helps organizations:  
\- Plan workforce needs by anticipating potential exits.  
\- Improve employee satisfaction by identifying factors influencing turnover.  
\- Implement targeted retention strategies to minimize turnover.

\## Models Used  
  
1\. \*\*Logistic Regression\*\*:  
\- Performed moderately well but showed lower recall for class 1 (employees who left).  
\- Confusion matrix showed more false negatives compared to Random Forest.  
  
2\. \*\*Random Forest Classifier\*\*:  
\- Achieved high accuracy with balanced precision, recall, and F1-score.  
\- Minimal misclassifications observed in the confusion matrix.  
\- Outperformed Logistic Regression significantly.  
  
\---  
  
\## Confusion Matrix and Classification Report  
  
We used confusion matrices and classification reports to evaluate the models, focusing on precision, recall, and F1-score.  
  
\### Random Forest  
\- High accuracy with balanced precision, recall, and F1-score.  
\- Minimal misclassifications, as shown in the confusion matrix.  
  
\### Logistic Regression  
\- Moderate performance but lower recall for class 1 (employees who left).  
\- More false negatives compared to Random Forest.  
  
\---  
  
\## ROC Curve  
  
\- The ROC curve compares model performance by plotting True Positive Rate vs. False Positive Rate.  
\- \*\*Random Forest\*\* shows a significantly higher AUC (0.98) compared to \*\*Logistic Regression\*\* (0.57), indicating its superior performance.  
  
\---  
  
\## Feature Importance  
  
We analyzed feature importance to understand the factors influencing employee turnover.  
  
\### Key Findings:  
\- Top features influencing turnover include:  
\- \*\*Satisfaction Level\*\* (38.80%)  
\- \*\*Average Monthly Hours\*\* (21.03%)  
\- \*\*Last Evaluation\*\* (19.57%)  
\- \*\*Number of Projects\*\* (18.49%)  
\- Less influential features include:  
\- \*\*Time Spent in Company\*\* (1.13%)  
\- \*\*Work Accident\*\* (0.21%)  
\- \*\*Promotion in Last 5 Years\*\* (0.19%)  
\- \*\*Salary\*\* (0.20%)  
\- \*\*Sales Department (IT & R&D)\*\* (0.18% - 0.20%)  
  
These insights help in making informed business decisions and developing targeted employee retention strategies.
